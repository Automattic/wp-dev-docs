post_title: Get started with Wordpress.com
---

Wordpress.com's managed hosting helps optimize your website for speed, security, and performance while taking care of many of the technical aspects of site management. Depending on your needs, you'll find a [range of plans](https://wordpress.com/pricing/) with increasingly powerful features designed to support every site type and budget.

You'll also find the tools, workflows, and infrastructure you need to build and deploy your website faster â€” from automated imports of existing Wordpress installations to a secure, globally distributed, performance-optimized CDN serving content from the nearest data centers to site vistitors.

Collaboration and iteration on your project are further supported with tools from staging sites and a 'coming soon' mode to real-time backups and one-click restores.

## Before you begin

You'll need to [sign up](https://wordpress.com/start) for a new WordPress.com account or [log in](https://wordpress.com/log-in) to an existing account.
