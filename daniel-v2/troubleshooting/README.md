# Troubleshooting

When something is going wrong on your WordPress.com site, we have a few features you can use:

- [Site Monitoring](site-monitoring.md) - TK site monitoring
- [Debugging](debugging.md) - TK debugging description
- [Jetpack Activity Log](jetpack-activity-log.md) - Shows a record of all activities and events on your website so you can see what happened when.
