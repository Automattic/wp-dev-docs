To begin, the first step is to create an account on WordPress.com. You have the option to 
use existing providers or your email account.

After adding your email, you will receive a confirmation email to activate your account.

Next, you can choose your domain. This step is optional, and you can select "Choose my domain later" if you prefer.

Once you have verified your email, you can select a plan. You have the option to start for free 
or [Starte with a free trial](https://wordpress.com/setup/new-hosted-site).

Following that, you can select your goals. This step is optional and can be completed later. If you 
choose to `Skip to dashboard`, you will see your newly created site on the WordPress dashboard 
with a name based on your username.
