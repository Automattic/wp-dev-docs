# Get Started

## Create an Account

To get started, the first step is to create an account on WordPress.com. You can sign up using your email or existing providers like Google or Apple.

After adding your email, you will receive a confirmation email to activate your account. Simply follow the link in the email to complete the account activation process. Once confirmed, you can proceed to the next steps.

## Start with a New Site

Next, you have the option to choose your domain. This step is optional, and if you prefer, you can select `Choose my domain later`.

In the following step, you can select a plan. You don't need to decide now, you have the option to start with a Free plan
or [Start with a Free Trial](https://wordpress.com/setup/new-hosted-site) that includes all the features of the `Creator` plan.

Following that, you can select your goals. This step is optional and can be completed later. If you 
choose to `Skip to dashboard`, you will see your newly created site on the WordPress dashboard 
with a name based on your username.
