# Real Time Backup

**VaultPress Backup** by Jetpack automatically saves every change and helps you get back online quickly with one‑click restores. This guide will show you how to access your site’s backups and restore your website to any previous point in time.

This feature is available on sites with the [WordPress.com Creator or Entrepreneur plan](https://wordpress.com/plans/). If your site has one of our legacy plans, it is available on the Pro plan.
